                    <p>The diet plan you pulled off a free website probably won’t work for you in the long run. <br> It means the free YouTube workout video you watched won’t help you reach the exact goals you’ve laid out for yourself.<br> <span>1.</span> With this app you can start having your own nutrition plan that is built for you based on your genetics, lifestyle, and preferences.<br> <span>2.</span> Let's start making your own workout plan crafted for your specific goals.</p>

                        <h1>Explosive leg work</h1>
                        <p>Level One: Alternating Step Ups (10 each leg) – Step with one leg, explode the other knee up towards the sky. Step back down, and switch legs. If you can’t explode the other knee up yet, just come to a full standing position on the top of the bench – that’s more than okay!<br> Level Two: Bench Jumps (10 reps) – Jump as high as possible, landing as softly as possible with a mid-foot strike. DO NOT JUMP DOWN – that’s how people blow out their achilles’ tendons. Step down. You’re welcome!</p>

                    <div class="pro">
                        <h1>Push Exercise</h1>
                        <p>Level One: Elevated Push Ups – Use the back of a bench to do your push ups. Keep your abs and butt tight and your elbows at your side. If you need to do your push ups against a wall or a fence, that’s okay too.<br> Level Two: Lower Incline Push Ups – use the seat part of a bench for your push ups.<br> Level Three: Regular Push Ups – If you can complete 3 sets of 10, aim for 3 sets of 20. If you can do that, make them harder by wearing a backpack or doing plyometric push ups.</p>

                        <h1>Pull Exercise</h1>
                        <p>Level One: Swing Rows – Grab the chains of a swing, lean back, make your body tight and straight, and use your back and arm muscles to pull yourself up.<br> Level Two: Body Rows – Find a bar that’s low enough, the underside of a table, a set of ladder rungs, whatever! Make your body into a tight plank, and use your arms to pull yourself up. Your park might even have a bar at this perfect height.<br> Level Three: Pull Ups – Grab the bar with palms AWAY from you (pull up) or FACING you (chin up). Engage your shoulders (pull your shoulder blades back and downward), keep your core tight, and pull your chest up towards the bar. If these are too tough, do NEGATIVES – jump above the bar, and lower yourself slowly.</p>
